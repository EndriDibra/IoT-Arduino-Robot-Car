# IoT-Arduino-Robot-Car
This project concerns the creation of an Arduino robot car, that will make use of IoT sensors like temperature, humidity and gas ones. Then will collect and send these data into a Flask server. Ultimately, these data will be processed by a machine learning model to make predictions on rainfall and fire occurrence.
