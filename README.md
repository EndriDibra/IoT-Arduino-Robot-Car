# IoT-Arduino-Robot-Car
This is a project created in IoT course from NKUA-DIND, supervised by Professor Panagiotis Gkonis.

This project concerns the creation of a 3D printed Arduino robot car, that will make use of IoT sensors like temperature, humidity and gas ones. Then will collect and send these data into a Flask server. Ultimately, these data will be processed by a machine learning model to make predictions on rainfall, and in arduino a fire occurrence will be under detection.
